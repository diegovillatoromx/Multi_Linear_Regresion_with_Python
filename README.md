# Multi Linear Regresion with Python

# Approach
- Import the required libraries and dataset
- Check for the correlation between features
- Plot a graph for correlations
- Remove the weakly correlated and highly multicollinear variables
- Perform train test split on the dataset
- Fit the multiple linear regression model
- Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables
- Plot the results

## Tech Stack
* Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy
